[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/BigWigs/compare/v387.2...v387.3) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/BigWigs/releases)

- Bump version  
- Plugins/Nameplates: Change the logic used to decide where icons are placed on the nameplate. For example if you want the icons starting in the top left and want them to grow right along the top of the nameplate, you no longer need to adjust the x/y offset to prevent the first icon floating too far out. Also change it so we stop ignoring the parent scale when 11.1.7 hits.
