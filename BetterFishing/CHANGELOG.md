# Info
Did you know? You can use controller bindings to fish
/console GamePadEnable 1 to enable gamepad mode
/console GamePadEnable 0 to disable gamepad mode again
in the keybinding ui you can then bind your controller key, and use that to fish with, sit back and relax
use the fantastic ConsolePort addon if you want a controller optimized UI
